# React Quiz - Lap 3 Project

## Description

This is the client-side code for a quiz app made with React.

## Deployment

- <a href="https://agtk-quiz.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>

## Usage

- This app has 2 modes: online and offline.
- Offline mode allows 2 players to compete against each other on the same computer.
- Online mode allows any number of players to compete against each other from different computers.
- When creating an offline game, the user must pass in a difficulty, category, and number of questions (which must be between 5 and 50).
- When creating an online game, the user must pass in a difficulty, category, number of questions (which must be between 5 and 50), and username.
- Once an offline game has been created, the quiz will start immediately.
- Once an online game has been created, the creator of the quiz will be redirected to the lobby with the room ID. Other players must then join the lobby by entering the room ID and their own username. The quiz will only begin when the creator clicks "Let's GO".

## Technologies

### React

We used React to build the user interface of our application.

### Redux

Redux was used for state management.

### Socket

We used Socket to allow bidirectional and low-latency communication across our application.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
